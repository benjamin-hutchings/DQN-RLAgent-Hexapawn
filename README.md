## Hexapawn Game Rules:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Each player starts with three pawns.
Pawns can move forward to an empty space or capture an opponent's pawn diagonally.
The game ends if a pawn reaches the opposite side, if a player cannot move, or if all of the opponent's pawns are captured.
